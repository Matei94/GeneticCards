GeneticCards
============

GeneticCards problem:

  		- there are <numCards> cards numbered from 1 to <numCards>
  		
  		- split the given <numCards> in 2 piles such that the sum of
  		the cards' values in the first pile to be <sumTarget> and the 
  		product of the cards' values in the second pile to be <prodTarget> 
  		
The implemented algorithm to solve the GeneticCards problem is an [Genetic Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).
